Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to help develop algorithms using english-like statements to express what code should do.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing. Pseudocode is not meant to be run as actual code, it needs to be reworked into a language of the code creator's choice in order to be of use in any practical settings.


Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number 
INPUT second number 
IF first number is greater than second number THEN 
  PRINT first number
ELSE 
  PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT total to 1
WHILE total is less than 101
  PRINT total
  SET total equal to total plus one
END WHILE


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT a name
FOR every entry in phonebook
  IF name is equal to an entry THEN
  RETURN true
ELSE
  RETURN false
END IF
END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var entries = ["Shawn Michaels", "Terry Boella", "Bret Hart"]

function entrySearch(arr, entry) {
  for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if(arr[i] == entry) {
      return true;
    }
  } return false;
}

entrySearch(entries, "Terry Boella");
